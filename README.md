## Getting Started
### 1. Install Required Tools
- **Go**: [Download and install Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- **Docker**: [Download and install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Minikube**: [Install Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/decentralized-multi-sig-wallet.git
cd decentralized-multi-sig-wallet
```

### 3. Initialize Go Module
```bash
go mod init github.com/username/decentralized-multi-sig-wallet
```

---

## Usage
1. **Run the API Server**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
2. **Test the Wallet Creation API**
   Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl` to send POST requests to `http://localhost:8080/wallets`.
